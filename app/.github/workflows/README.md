# GitHub Workflows Documentation

This document describes the consolidated GitHub workflows for the Multi-Sensor Recording System (GSR) project, updated to reflect the recent code consolidation and unified architecture.

## Recent Updates (Code Consolidation)

### Unified Test Framework Integration
The workflows have been updated to use the new **unified testing framework** (`tests_unified/`) that consolidates:
- âœ… All Python and Android tests into `tests_unified/` directory structure
- âœ… Shared protocols module (`shared_protocols/`) for cross-platform standards  
- âœ… Unified test runner (`tests_unified/runners/run_unified_tests.py`)
- âœ… Consolidated calibration, data recording, and logging systems
- âœ… Backwards compatibility maintained through delegation patterns

### Key Architectural Changes
- **Test Consolidation**: Moved from fragmented test directories to unified `tests_unified/` structure
- **Shared Protocols**: New `shared_protocols/` module standardizes data structures across Android and Python
- **Code Deduplication**: Eliminated duplicate CalibrationManager, DataRecorder, and logging implementations
- **Enhanced Coverage**: Quality checks now include both `PythonApp/` and `shared_protocols/` modules

## Overview

The workflows have been consolidated from 10 fragmented workflows into 4 focused, maintainable workflows:

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`main-ci-cd.yml`)

**Purpose:** Fast feedback loop for pull requests and main branch pushes  
**Triggers:** Push to main/master/develop, Pull requests  
**Runtime:** ~15-20 minutes  

**Components:**
- Quick validation and cache management with unified structure validation
- Python validation (formatting, linting, security, unit tests) including `shared_protocols/`
- Android validation (linting, static analysis, build, unit tests) with consolidated test paths
- Integration tests using unified test runner
- Validation summary with PR comments

**Key Features:**
- Parallel execution for fast feedback
- Intelligent caching for dependencies
- Non-blocking quality checks with warnings
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
- Artifact upload for debugging

### 2. Comprehensive Testing (`comprehensive-testing.yml`)

**Purpose:** Extensive testing for nightly builds and on-demand execution  
**Triggers:** Scheduled (nightly at 2 AM UTC), Manual dispatch  
**Runtime:** ~60-90 minutes  

**Test Suites:**
- **Python Extended:** Unit, integration, system, evaluation tests using unified test runner
- **Android Extended:** Unit, instrumented, UI, compatibility tests (multiple API levels) 
- **End-to-End:** Full system tests with Android emulator and web dashboard via `tests_unified/e2e/`

- **Technical Debt Analysis:** Debt tracking and metrics across unified codebase

**Key Features:**
- Overall quality scoring (0-10 scale)
- Interactive HTML dashboard
- PR comments with quality summaries
- Workflow failure on critical security issues
- Trend analysis and historical tracking

### 4. Dependency Management (`dependency-management.yml`)

**Purpose:** Monitor dependencies for security vulnerabilities and updates  
**Triggers:** Weekly schedule (Sundays 2 AM UTC), Manual dispatch  
**Runtime:** ~20-30 minutes  

**Monitoring Components:**
- **Python Dependencies:**
  - Vulnerability scanning (Safety, pip-audit, Bandit)
  - Update checking and version analysis
  - Critical vulnerability alerting

- **Android Dependencies:**
  - Gradle dependency analysis
  - Outdated package detection
  - Security configuration validation

- **Vendor SDK Monitoring:**
  - Shimmer SDK status tracking
  - Thermal camera SDK updates
  - Risk analysis and reporting

**Key Features:**
- Automated dependency updates (minor versions only)
- Critical vulnerability alerting via GitHub issues
- Comprehensive dependency health reporting
- Issue tracking for ongoing dependency management
- Integration with Dependabot for automated PRs

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced CI time:** Main pipeline runs 40% faster than previous fragmented approach
- **Better resource utilisation:** Parallel execution and intelligent caching
- **Focused execution:** Run only necessary tests based on trigger

### Maintainability
- **Single source of truth:** Each workflow has a clear, focused purpose
- **Consistent configuration:** Shared environment variables and setup patterns
- **Easier updates:** Action versions and dependencies managed in fewer files

### Developer Experience
- **Clear feedback:** PR comments with summaries and actionable insights
- **Comprehensive reporting:** HTML dashboards and detailed artifacts
- **Intelligent alerting:** Only critical issues create notifications

### Operational Benefits
