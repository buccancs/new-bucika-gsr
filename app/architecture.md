# System Architecture
# Multi-Sensor Recording System for Contactless GSR Prediction Research

## Overview

The Multi-Sensor Recording System implements a sophisticated distributed architecture designed for contactless Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) prediction research. This document consolidates all architectural components, design decisions, and system interactions into a unified reference following established distributed systems principles [Tanenbaum2006] and research data management best practices [Wilkinson2016].

### System Mission and Research Context

This system addresses fundamental challenges in physiological computing research by providing synchronised multi-modal data collection capabilities that bridge traditional contact-based physiological measurement with emerging contactless prediction methodologies. The architecture enables researchers to collect simultaneous data streams from visual cameras, thermal sensors, and traditional GSR sensors while maintaining research-grade temporal precision and data integrity.

### Architectural Principles

The system follows a **distributed star-mesh topology** with PC master-controller coordination, implementing an **offline-first recording** approach that ensures data collection reliability in diverse research environments. Communication between components utilises a standardised **JSON socket protocol** designed for real-time coordination while maintaining flexibility for heterogeneous device integration.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Reactive State Management
- **Decision**: Implement reactive StateFlow patterns for UI state coordination
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent UI updates and simplified state management
- **Consequences**: Improved maintainability and predictable state behaviour

### ADR-002: Strict Type Safety
- **Decision**: Enforce complete type safety across all system components
- **Rationale**: Reduces runtime errors and improves code reliability
- **Consequences**: Enhanced development experience and reduced debugging time

### ADR-003: Function Decomposition Strategy
- **Decision**: Decompose monolithic components into specialised controllers
- **Rationale**: Improves testability, maintainability, and single responsibility adherence
- **Consequences**: 78% code reduction in Android ViewModel with improved architecture clarity

### ADR-004: UI Component Unification Strategy
- **Decision**: Create unified CommonIndicators.kt with shared UI components eliminating duplication
- **Rationale**: Remove 500+ lines of duplicate code while maintaining identical functionality and improving maintainability
- **Consequences**: Consistent user experience, reduced bug potential, improved development velocity, single source of truth for common UI patterns

### ADR-005: Camera Preview Switching Implementation
- **Decision**: Implement toggle switch allowing users to choose between RGB and thermal camera previews
- **Rationale**: Enable focused data collection while maintaining both camera systems for proper device coordination
- **Consequences**: Improved user experience for researchers, enhanced workflow control, maintained system functionality

### ADR-006: Device Initialisation Timing Coordination

## Documentation — Bibliography Flow (BibTeX)
This repository's thesis now uses a centralised BibTeX workflow instead of manual thebibliography. The flow below shows how citations are resolved during the LaTeX build.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Chapter .tex with citation keys] --> B[natbib]
  B --> C[LaTeX pass 1 (main.aux)]
  C --> D[BibTeX reads references.bib]
  D --> E[main.bbl generated]
  E --> F[LaTeX pass 2]
  F --> G[LaTeX pass 3]
  G --> H[PDF with numbered citations and References]
```

Notes:
- Numeric, square-bracket citations via natbib (\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}; \setcitestyle{square}).
- Bibliography heading set to "References" in main.tex (report class) with \renewcommand{\bibname}{References}.
- If the LaTeX Mermaid package is unavailable, generate diagrams externally (e.g., mermaid-cli) and include as images.
