\subsection{I.1 Content Migration Notice}

All content previously contained in this appendix has been moved to Appendix Z: Consolidated Figures, Diagrams, and Visual Content with the following mapping:

\subsubsection{I.1.1 Chapter 4 Figures: Design and Implementation}
- Original Sections I.1.1-I.1.3 → Now in Appendix Z, Sections Z.3.1-Z.3.3
- Figure 4.1: System Architecture Overview → Appendix Z, Section Z.3.1
- Figure 4.2: Thermal Integration Flow → Appendix Z, Section Z.3.1
- Figure 4.3: Shimmer GSR Integration → Appendix Z, Section Z.3.1
- Figure 4.4: Desktop GUI Layout → Appendix Z, Section Z.3.2
- Figure 4.5: Protocol Sequence → Appendix Z, Section Z.3.3
- Figure 4.6: Data Processing Pipeline → Appendix Z, Section Z.3.3

\subsubsection{I.1.2 Appendix G Figures: Diagnostic and Performance Analysis}
- Original Section I.2.1 → Now in Appendix Z, Section Z.4.1
- Figure G.1: Device Discovery Pattern → Appendix Z, Section Z.4.1
- Figure G.2: System Reliability Analysis → Appendix Z, Section Z.4.1
- Figure G.3: System Reliability Summary → Appendix Z, Section Z.4.1

\subsubsection{I.1.3 Conceptual Diagrams and System Models}
- Original Sections I.3-I.5 → Now in Appendix Z, Sections Z.1-Z.3
- All Mermaid diagrams (I.1-I.9) → Corresponding sections in Appendix Z
- Background concepts → Appendix Z, Section Z.1
- Requirements diagrams → Appendix Z, Section Z.2
- Implementation diagrams → Appendix Z, Section Z.3

\subsection{I.2 Updated Reference Instructions}

For Authors and Readers:
- All figure references should now point to Appendix Z
- Use format: "see Figure X.Y in Appendix Z" for cross-references
- Navigation aid: Appendix Z includes comprehensive cross-reference tables
- Print compatibility: Both Mermaid (dynamic) and PNG (static) versions available

For Document Maintenance:
- Single source of truth: All visual content now centralised in Appendix Z
- Reduced duplication: Eliminates redundant figure storage across appendices
- Improved consistency: Unified formatting and referencing standards
- Enhanced navigation: Cross-reference tables enable quick figure location

\subsection{I.3 Cross-Reference Quick Index}

| Original Reference | New Location | Content Type |
|---|---|---|
| Appendix I, Section I.1 | Appendix Z, Section Z.3 | Chapter 4 Implementation Figures |
| Appendix I, Section I.2 | Appendix Z, Section Z.4 | Performance Diagnostic Figures |
| Appendix I, Section I.3 | Appendix Z, Section Z.1 | Background Conceptual Diagrams |
| Appendix I, Section I.4 | Appendix Z, Section Z.2 | Requirements Architecture Diagrams |
| Appendix I, Section I.5 | Appendix Z, Section Z.4 | Performance Analysis Models |

This appendix remains for reference but all active content has been moved to Appendix Z for improved thesis organisation and reduced redundancy.
