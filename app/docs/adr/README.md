# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Multi-Sensor Recording System. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the project's development, providing context, alternatives considered, and rationale for choices made.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand:

- **Why** certain decisions were made
- **What alternatives** were considered
- **What trade-offs** were evaluated
- **What consequences** the decisions have

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# ADR-### [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Authors**: [Name(s)]
**Tags**: [relevant, tags, for, categorisation]

## Context

Brief description of the situation and problem requiring a decision.

## Decision

The architectural decision that was made.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Alternative 1**: Description and why it was not chosen
2. **Alternative 2**: Description and why it was not chosen
3. **Alternative 3**: Description and why it was not chosen

## Consequences

### Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2

### Neutral
- Implication 1
- Implication 2

## Implementation Notes

Specific implementation details or guidelines.

## Creating New ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architectural patterns** (MVVM vs MVP, reactive vs imperative)
- **Technology choices** (StateFlow vs LiveData, WebSocket vs REST)
- **Design principles** (offline-first, security-first, etc.)
- **Quality standards** (test coverage targets, complexity limits)
- **Integration strategies** (synchronisation protocols, communication methods)

### ADR Creation Process

1. **Identify Decision Point**: Recognise when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Research Alternatives**: Investigate different approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Draft ADR**: Use the template to document the decision
4. **Review with Team**: Get feedback on the analysis and decision
5. **Finalise and Commit**: Mark as "Accepted" and commit to repository

### File Naming Convention

```
ADR-{number}-{kebab-case-title}.md
```

Examples:
- `ADR-009-async-data-processing.md`
- `ADR-010-camera-calibration-strategy.md`
- `ADR-011-error-handling-patterns.md`

## ADR Lifecycle

### Status Transitions

- **Proposed** → **Accepted**: Decision is made and implemented
- **Accepted** → **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended for new code
- **Accepted** → **Superseded**: Decision is replaced by a newer ADR

### Maintaining ADRs

- **Regular Review**: Quarterly review of existing ADRs for relevance
- **Update References**: Keep links and references current
- **Cross-Reference**: Link related ADRs and implementation files
- **Deprecation Process**: Clearly mark outdated decisions

## Integration with Development Process

### Code Reviews

Reference relevant ADRs during code reviews:
```markdown
This implementation follows the reactive state management pattern 
established in ADR-001. The StateFlow usage ensures proper lifecycle 
management as documented.
```

### Documentation Links

Link to ADRs from code comments when implementing architectural decisions:
```kotlin
/**
 * Implements reactive state management following ADR-001.
 * StateFlow provides lifecycle-aware state updates with proper 
 * backpressure handling as required by our architecture.
 */
private val _state = MutableStateFlow(InitialState)
```

### Onboarding

New contributors should review key ADRs to understand architectural decisions:

1. **Start with**: ADR-001 (State Management), ADR-003 (MVVM), ADR-008 (Testing)
2. **For Android**: ADR-001, ADR-003, ADR-007 (Security)
3. **For Python**: ADR-002 (Type Safety), ADR-004 (Synchronisation)
4. **For Integration**: ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-006

## Quality Assurance

### ADR Review Checklist

- [ ] **Clear Context**: Problem and constraints are well-defined
- [ ] **complete Alternatives**: Multiple options evaluated
- [ ] **Evidence-Based**: Decisions supported by research or testing
- [ ] **Consequence Analysis**: Both positive and negative impacts identified
- [ ] **Implementation Guidance**: Clear direction for developers
- [ ] **Proper References**: Links to standards, papers, and related decisions

### Templates and Tools

- **Template**: Use `ADR-TEMPLATE.md` for new decisions
- **Validation**: Check ADRs during code review process
- **Tracking**: Maintain ADR index with status and cross-references
- **Integration**: Link ADRs with implementation code

## Research Integration

### Academic Standards

ADRs in this project follow academic research standards:

- **Literature Review**: Reference relevant research papers
- **Methodology**: Document evaluation criteria and testing approaches
- **Validation**: Include experimental results where applicable
- **Citation Format**: Use standard academic citation style [Author(Year)]

## Contributing to ADRs

### For Maintainers

- **Regular Updates**: Update ADR status as architecture evolves
- **Cross-Referencing**: Maintain links between related decisions
- **Quality Control**: Ensure new ADRs meet documentation standards
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Use ADRs during team onboarding

### For Contributors

- **Reference Existing**: Check relevant ADRs before proposing changes
- **Propose New**: Suggest ADRs for significant architectural decisions
- **Question Decisions**: Ask about rationale using ADR framework
- **Implementation Consistency**: Follow established patterns documented in ADRs

---

**Next Steps**: Review the existing ADRs to understand our architectural foundation, then refer to them during development to ensure consistency with established patterns and decisions.
