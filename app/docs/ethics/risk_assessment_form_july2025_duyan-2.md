# PLANNING STAGES OF RESEARCH PROJECT

### ESSENTIAL SAFETY PROCEDURES

- Follow UCL safety procedures

- Follow Departmental safety guidelines where applicable

- Follow UCL procedures on Laboratory work, Biohazards etc. where
  applicable

- Contact Departmental Safety Officer (DSO) for guidelines on
  Departmental laboratory environments where applicable

- Inform Supervisor/Line Manager of any changes in an experimenter's
  ability to undertake tasks, e.g. illness or pregnancy, so that risk
  assessments can be reviewed. Report any accidents/incidents that cause
  injury or damage to property or any dangerous occurrences to their
  Supervisor/Line Manager

- Each employee/student is responsible for remaining aware of the Health
  and Safety at Work Act (1974)
  [[http://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm]{.underline}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm)
  and their duties and requirements under the Management of Health and
  Safety at Work Regulations (1999).

- Become familiar with any existing emergency procedures (e.g. fire,
  accident, violence) for the specific building where research/activity
  is being conducted, including

  - Telephone number to ring in emergency (this may not be 999)

  - Designated First Aider on site

- Consult BPS Code of Ethics and Conduct for further information:

> [*[http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/code_of_ethics_and_conduct.pdf]{.underline}*](http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/code_of_ethics_and_conduct.pdf)

### TRAINING AND INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF RESEARCHER REGARDING TRAINING AND HEALTH & SAFETY

> Providing training on the methods and equipment that will be used in a
> research project can help researchers manage difficult situations,
> (e.g. a participant becoming aggressive or agitated) and will ensure
> that any necessary equipment is used correctly. Training needs will
> depend upon both the nature of the project and the skills of the
> individual researcher.
>
> The health risks may also vary for individual researchers on the same
> project and should be addressed accordingly (e.g. provide support for
> any vulnerabilities or pre-existing health conditions, including
> disability and pregnancy).
>
> **Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any
> risks: \-\-- -** Carefully consider any physical demands and whether
> the researcher is suited to these

- [ ] Provide training on interviewing/assessment techniques/test
  procedures

- [ ] Provide training on specialist methodological procedures

- [ ] Provide training for specialist equipment

- [ ] Check whether immunisations up-to-date as appropriate

- [ ] Organise first-aid training to help deal with health risks

> ☒Consider precautions needed relevant to researcher's vulnerabilities
> (e.g. carry asthma inhaler, limit need to climb stairs, etc)

- [ ] Other (please describe):

### DATA PROTECTION

> As a centre of knowledge and training, UCL focuses on exploiting
> information. Next to people, information is UCL's most important
> asset. The information we use exists in many forms: printed or written
> on paper, stored electronically, transmitted by post or using
> electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation.
> Regardless of the form it takes, or means by which it is shared or
> stored, information should always be protected appropriately. The
> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the legislation under
> which personal data is protected.
>
> Researchers and students involved in research projects should complete
> the UCL GDPR online training course:
> [[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-protection/data-protection-]{.underline}](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-protection/data-protection-overview/online-training/data-protection-online-training)
> [[overview/online-training/data-protection-online-training]{.underline}](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-protection/data-protection-overview/online-training/data-protection-online-training)

#### Please indicate if you have completed the GDPR online training course:

☒ I have completed and passed the UCL GDPR online training course

> GDPR places strict regulations on the processing of data in non-EU
> countries. If you will be processing data from a non-EU country, both
> the researcher and the PI should ensure to read the guidance on
> processing personal data overseas, observed here:
> [[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/sites/pals/files/pals_guidance_studentsprocessingpersonaldat]{.underline}](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/sites/pals/files/pals_guidance_studentsprocessingpersonaldataoverseas.docx.pdf)
> [[aoverseas.docx.pdf]{.underline}](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/sites/pals/files/pals_guidance_studentsprocessingpersonaldataoverseas.docx.pdf)
> .

- [ ] I (the researcher) have read the guidance on processing personal
  data overseas, and will comply with it.

- [ ] I (the PI) have read the guidance on processing personal data
  overseas, and will comply with it.

2.  **OFF-SITE VISITS**

> **Please complete this Section if you will be conducting off-site
> visits at any stage during your research project. If you are not
> intending to make off-site visits, go straight to Section 3.**

## PREPARATION AND TRAVELLING

> Off-site visits can carry a number of risks, for example being in an
> isolated or dangerous setting, mugging or attack, and a lack of
> support in a difficult encounter.

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

- [ ] Evaluate whether an off-site visit is appropriate and necessary

- [ ] Where there is little or no information regarding the participant,
  try to arrange the first meeting on-site

- [ ] Check car insurance and roadworthiness of car if driving

- [ ] Aim to not conduct off-site visits outside normal working hours,
  but have a plan of action if this is unavoidable

- [ ] Aim to carry out visit in daylight where possible

- [ ] Ensure no off-site visit is conducted alone, unless a supervisor
  has agreed that the visit presents minimal risk

- [ ] Ensure experimenter is aware of any relevant background
  information on the individual/family.

- [ ] Plan routes and transport well in advance, and carry
  maps/timetables as appropriate

- [ ] Wear appropriate clothing and footwear

- [ ] Avoid carrying confidential materials where possible

- [ ] Ensure that appropriate DBS clearance is in place if experimenter
  will be working alone with children or vulnerable adults

- [ ] Always carry your UCL ID card

- [ ] Avoid carrying large amounts of cash, valuables and jewellery

- [ ] Be vigilant in areas that could present safety risks, e.g. mugging

- [ ] Consider strategies that may reduce such risks (such as travelling
  in taxis, disguising laptops in non-laptop style bags)

- [ ] Carry a mobile phone to call for help in the case of an emergency

- [ ] Leave an expected schedule (i.e. the names and addresses of
  visits) as well as your expected time of return with a
  colleague/family member/friend

- [ ] Have an agreed plan of action with them if you do not return when
  expected

- [ ] Other(please describe):

## CONDUCT DURING AND ON RETURN FROM VISIT

> Seeing a participant off-site can present risks such as physical or
> verbal abuse or harassment. Being vigilant both when going to and from
> the site and during the visit can reduce risk. Do not hesitate to
> terminate the visit if concerned about safety.
>
> Ensuring safe return from an off-site visit can be done by informing
> family, friends or colleagues, who should be prepared if necessary to
> take action if the researcher does not return or make contact when
> expected

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

- [ ] Aim to park in a public/well-lit area

- [ ] Carry a charged mobile phone and call for help if necessary

- [ ] Make a mental note of routes in and out of the premises to aid a
  quick entry and exit if safety concerns arise

- [ ] Minimise presence of potential weapons (such as sharp or heavy
  objects) or hazards of clothing and jewellery (e.g. scarves, earrings)
  that could lead to the researcher being harmed

- [ ] Permit participant to terminate session at any time without being
  required to justify it

- [ ] Plan an early exit strategy (such as a call to/from the office) in
  case of safety concerns

- [ ] Terminate session if participant's behaviour gives any cause for
  concern

- [ ] Ensure a designated person knows where you are and when you are
  expected to

> return

- [ ] Call/notify the designated person to let them know when the visit
  is over and they are home safely

- [ ] Have a plan of action if you do not return when expected (e.g.
  they call the police)

- [ ] Report any concerns as soon as possible in writing to
  supervisor/manager

- [ ] Other (please describe):

# ON-SITE APPOINTMENTS

## ARRANGING APPOINTMENTS

> Anticipating potential difficulties when preparing for appointments
> can reduce interpersonal risks such as violence or aggressive
> behaviour.
>
> NB: Safety procedures should be in place to safeguard any appointments
> outside normal working hours.

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

> ☒Set appointments with participants to fall within the building's
> normal opening hours (usually Mon-Fri, 9am-6pm)
>
> ☒If appointments with participants are scheduled to fall outside
> normal opening hours, then 2 experimenters will be present at all
> times, the researcher's
>
> supervisor/manager will be notified of and give approval to the
> out-of-hours testing, and Security will be informed of the planned
> testing, including the names and scheduled times of participants and
> the room number where testing will take place
>
> ☒Ensure adequate facilities and arrangements are in place for any
> participants with disabilities (e.g. restricted mobility, poor vision,
> hearing)

- [ ] Send participant an appointment letter stating the date and time
  of their visit, and the name of the researcher running it -- this
  could be shown on demand

> ☒Keep a diary of appointments for participants visiting UCL premises

- [ ] Arrange to see participant in pairs if there are any concerns
  (e.g. if the participant is deemed to present risks, the lab is
  isolated etc.)

- [ ] Plan appropriate back-up procedures (e.g. observation window in
  place, door open, colleague making regular checks, a code word or
  phrase to indicate risk, or use of personal alarm system)

- [ ] Other (please Describe):

## LAYOUT & EQUIPM ENT

> The layout of a room can carry certain risks, for example leading the
> participant to become anxious, agitated or aggressive -- particularly
> if intrusive equipment (e.g. TMS; eye-tracking equipment) is involved.
> Setting up equipment properly will reduce risks of fault and potential
> injury (e.g. radiation).

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

> ☒Consider optimal layout of physical environment to reduce potential
> participant anxiety (e.g. ensure chairs of equal height, ensure
> adequate distance between people)

- [ ] Arrange furniture so that access to an escape route is made
  available to both researcher and participant

> ☒Minimise presence of potential weapons (such as sharp or heavy
> objects) or hazards of clothing and jewellery (e.g. scarves, earrings)
> that could lead to the researcher being harmed.
>
> ☒Equipment will only be used according to the manufacturer's
>
> instructions
>
> ☒Equipment will be regularly maintained, and is transported and
> secured safely
>
> ☒Researchers will follow local safety procedures for working in
> laboratory environments, to reduce risk of harm, for example due to
> radiation

- [ ] Other (please describe):

## MEETING PARTICIPANTS

> The way in which participants are greeted and put at ease can have an
> impact on the success of the visit, and reduce risks such as distress
> or aggression.

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

> ☒Ensure that researcher's clothing is professional and does not cause
> offence
>
> ☒Ensure that participants are expected in reception areas and
> anticipate early
>
> arrivals
>
> ☒Ensure professional boundaries at all times. This will include
> discouraging inappropriate behaviour and personal questions (such as
> requests from participants for experimenter's personal information).
>
> ☒Ensure that appointments take place on time to reduce potential
> anxiety or agitation caused by having to wait
>
> ☒Keep participant's contact details available to follow up if they are
> late, to ensure they are not lost

- [ ] Other (please describe)

## DURING AND AFTER INTERVIEW/ASSESSMENT/TEST PROCEDURE

> The physical layout of the environment may present a number of risks,
> for example being in an isolated room or out of earshot or view,
> carrying out procedures that raise anxiety etc.

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

> ☒Ensure that planned back-up procedures are in place (see 3.1)
>
> ☒Permit participant to terminate session at any time without being
> required to
>
> justify it
>
> ☒Plan an early exit strategy (such as a call to/from the office) in
> case of safety concerns
>
> ☒Terminate session if participant's behaviour gives any cause for
> concern (e.g. appears agitated, markedly withdrawn, under the
> influence of alcohol or drugs)
>
> ☒After the session, escort participants to the exit or arrange for
> someone else to do so to reduce the risk of them being left in the
> building without authorisation
>
> ☒Confirm to colleague after session is finished
>
> ☒Report any concerns raised as soon as possible in writing to
> supervisor/manager

- [ ] Other (please describe):

## PERSONAL DISTRESS

> Various features of an appointment, for example a complex task,
> discussing a difficult subject, or challenging participant behaviour
> can cause distress for both participant and researcher.

#### Please indicate any measures you will implement to control any risks:

> ☒Participants should be fully debriefed, including an information
> sheet about the research, and have an opportunity to ask questions
>
> ☒All incidents or "near misses" should be reported to the supervisor
>
> ☒A strategy to monitor incidents should be developed, and control
> measures put in place accordingly
>
> ☒If researchers experience any personal distress as a result of an
> appointment with a participant, they should discuss the incident with
> their supervisor and receive appropriate support
