# Chapter 5 Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing infrastructure implemented to meet Chapter 5 evaluation requirements for the Multi-Sensor Recording System. The implementation provides quantitative evidence collection, reproducible measurements, and automated validation protocols required for academic thesis evaluation.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

## Generated Artifacts (Sample Run)

### CSV Data Files
```
test_results/chapter5_artifacts/
├── drift_results.csv (18.6 KB) - 150 synchronisation measurements
├── calib_metrics.csv (2.2 KB) - 16 calibration accuracy measurements  
├── net_bench.csv (2.0 KB) - 50 network performance measurements
└── measurement_summary.json (410 B) - Generation metadata
```

### Sample Data Quality
- **Synchronisation**: 25 sessions × 6 devices = 150 data points with outlier detection
- **Calibration**: 4 cameras × 4 measurement types = 16 calibration validations
- **Network**: 5 RTT conditions × 2 TLS modes + scalability = 50+ measurements

### Reproducibility Framework
- Deterministic scripts with fixed random seeds
- Documented environment specifications
- Timestamped artifacts with generation metadata
- CSV-backed visualizations for data transparency

## Next Steps

### Remaining Implementation Tasks
1. **Python Import Resolution**: Fix module import issues in test_memory_leak_detector.py
2. **Android Test Execution**: Verify Android unit tests compile and run in Gradle environment
3. **CI Workflow Validation**: Test fast/nightly/release lanes in GitHub Actions
4. **Samsung Device Testing**: Document specific device testing procedures and results
5. **Artifact Integration**: Ensure all CSV files integrate properly with thesis Chapter 6 claims

### Validation Approach
1. Run fast lane CI to validate unit test coverage gates
2. Execute nightly integration to generate synchronisation evidence  
3. Perform abbreviated endurance test (1-hour) to validate performance monitoring
4. Generate complete measurement artifacts for Chapter 5 appendices
5. Document all procedures for reproducibility and academic review
