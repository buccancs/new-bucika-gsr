- **Mermaid in LaTeX Integration (2025-08-11)**
  - Enabled Mermaid rendering via `\usepackage{mermaid}` in `docs/thesis_report/final/latex/main.tex`.
  - Inserted compiled Mermaid examples (flowchart + sequence) in `appendix_Z.tex` under a new "Rendered Mermaid Diagrams (LaTeX)" section while retaining existing verbatim content for completeness.
  - Added tests: `tests/docs/test_mermaid_integration.py` to verify the preamble and presence of `\begin{mermaid}` in Appendix Z.
  - Updated `docs/thesis_report/README.md` with build instructions (use `-shell-escape`, Node.js, and `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`).
  - Added Mermaid pipeline diagram: `docs/diagrams/mermaid_latex_integration.mmd` documenting the LaTeX + Mermaid build flow.
  - Notes: Keep `external/` and `docs/generated_docs` excluded from artifacts. Mermaid rendering requires Node + mmdc available on PATH.


### Changed (2025-08-11)
- Migrated thesis references to BibTeX (natbib numeric, abbrvnat). Consolidated entries in `docs/thesis_report/final/latex/references.bib` (keys: ref1–ref24).
- Updated `docs/thesis_report/final/latex/main.tex` to use a global bibliography block (`\setcitestyle{square}`, `\bibliographystyle{abbrvnat}`, `\bibliography{references}`) and removed `\input{references}`.
- Replaced hard-coded numeric citations in `docs/thesis_report/final/latex/2.tex` with `\cite{...}` and removed its local References stub.
- Added `docs/thesis_report/final/latex/README.md` with BibTeX build steps and a Mermaid diagram of the bibliography flow.
- Updated `architecture.md` with a "Bibliography Flow (BibTeX)" Mermaid diagram.
- Updated `backlog.md` with follow-ups: convert remaining chapters/appendices to `\cite`, enrich BibTeX metadata, and validate LaTeX build toolchain (Mermaid optional).

### Changed (2025-08-11 13:30)
- Synchronised Chapter 2 LaTeX with Markdown source:
  - Updated docs/thesis_report/final/latex/2.tex to mirror docs/thesis_report/final/2.md (Sections 2.1–2.8), including full 2.7 hypothesis details and 2.8 sensor device selection rationale.
  - Preserved numeric citations by mapping [n] to \cite{refn} placeholders where applicable (ref1, ref3, ref4, ref5, ref6, ref7, ref8, ref10, ref11, ref15, ref16, ref20, ref21, ref22).
  - Escaped LaTeX-sensitive symbols (%, ×, μ, ±, °) and kept units/values consistent with the Markdown text.
  - Added a brief References note at end to match Markdown.
  - Note: No architectural changes; no code logic affected. See backlog for citation mapping to BibTeX and LaTeX main integration.


### Changed (2025-08-11 14:16)
- Synchronised Chapter 3 LaTeX with Markdown source:
  - Updated docs/thesis_report/final/latex/3.tex to mirror docs/thesis_report/final/3.md (Sections 3.1–3.7) and align text content.
  - Fixed internal cross-reference to System Analysis and added a label (\label{sec:system-analysis}).
  - Escaped LaTeX-sensitive symbols and units (× -> $\times$, ~ -> $\sim$, \mu as $\mu$) and verified key values/units.
  - Added a References note at end of chapter to match Markdown.
  - Note: No architectural changes; Mermaid source for Fig. 3.1 retained as TODO. Citation mapping to BibTeX for Chapter 3 remains tracked in backlog.


### Changed (2025-08-11 14:41)
- Synchronised Chapter 4 LaTeX with Markdown source:
  - Verified docs/thesis_report/final/latex/4.tex mirrors docs/thesis_report/final/4.md (Sections 4.1–4.7) and aligned text content.
  - Added a References note at the end of 4.tex to match Markdown.
  - Verified symbol/unit formatting consistency (× -> $\times$, ~ -> $\sim$, \mu as $\mu$ where applicable); no structural changes needed.
  - Figure 4.6 duplication retained to mirror Markdown; assets to be verified.
  - No architectural changes; citation mapping to BibTeX and figure asset checks remain tracked in backlog.
