---

## ðŸ”§ Configuration and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Repository Secrets** (for Firebase Test Lab):
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

2. **GitHub Permissions**:
   - Actions: read/write
   - Contents: read/write  
   - Pages: write
   - Security-events: write

3. **Branch Protection** (recommended):
   - Require status checks from performance and security workflows
   - Require up-to-date branches before merging

### Workflow Triggers

All enhancements support multiple trigger types:

- **Push/Pull Request**: Automatic execution on code changes
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Manual triggering from GitHub UI
- **Scheduled**: Nightly/weekly comprehensive analysis
- **Label-based**: Special features triggered by PR labels

### Customization

Each workflow includes configurable parameters:

```yaml
env:
  JAVA_VERSION: '17'              # Java version for builds
  API_LEVEL: 29                   # Android API level for testing
  PERFORMANCE_TIMEOUT: 45         # Test timeout in minutes
  SECURITY_SCAN_SEVERITY: 'HIGH'  # Security scan sensitivity
```
