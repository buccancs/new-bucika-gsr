## Gate Enforcement Levels

### BLOCKING (Build Fails)
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Critical defects in production code
- Coverage drops below 70%
- Complexity exceeds 30 per method

### WARNING (Build Succeeds with Warnings)
- Medium security vulnerabilities
- Coverage below targets but above 70%
- Configuration complexity issues
- High code churn in stable modules

### INFORMATIONAL (Logged Only)
- Documentation coverage gaps
- Performance degradation trends
- Technical debt accumulation
- Code style violations

## Quality Gate Overrides

### Temporary Overrides (Valid for 30 days)
- Legacy code modernization efforts
- Large refactoring initiatives
- Hardware integration experiments
- Performance optimization sprints

### Permanent Exceptions
- Third-party library integration files
- Auto-generated code
- Test fixtures and mock data
- Build configuration templates

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Daily Checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Build health monitoring
- Performance regression detection

### Weekly Reports
- Quality trends analysis
- Coverage progression tracking
- Technical debt assessment

### Monthly Reviews
- Quality gate threshold validation
- Process improvement assessment
- Tool effectiveness evaluation

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status (Based on Real Metrics)
- **Codebase Size**: 1,060 source files, ~180k LOC
- **Test Coverage**: 23 test files with 487 unit tests, 481 integration tests
- **Configuration**: 21 Gradle files, 366-line main build.gradle (needs refactoring)
- **Security**: 738 potential secret references (needs manual review and filtering)
- **Documentation**: 15 documentation files, 27 README files

### Priority Actions Required
1. **Configuration Refactoring**: Split 366-line build.gradle into modular files
2. **Security Review**: Filter false positives from 738 potential secret references
3. **Test Coverage**: Focus on increasing coverage from 84% to 90% target
4. **Documentation**: Add 5-10 more documentation files to reach 95% coverage

### Tools Integration
- CI/CD: Automated gate checking on every PR
- Pre-commit: Quality validation before commit
- IDE: Real-time quality feedback during development
- Reporting: Weekly quality dashboard updates
