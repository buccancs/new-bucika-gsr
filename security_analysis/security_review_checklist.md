# Security Review Checklist

## Pre-Review Setup
- [ ] Backup original suppression file
- [ ] Apply enhanced suppression rules
- [ ] Run updated security scan
- [ ] Generate filtered findings report

## Manual Review Process

### For Each Remaining Finding:
1. **Assess Impact**
   - [ ] Does this affect production code?
   - [ ] Is this a legitimate security vulnerability?
   - [ ] What's the exploit potential?

2. **Determine Action**
   - [ ] Suppress if false positive (with documentation)
   - [ ] Fix if legitimate vulnerability
   - [ ] Plan update if dependency issue

3. **Document Decision**
   - [ ] Add suppression rule with clear reasoning
   - [ ] Create issue for fixes required
   - [ ] Update security documentation

## Categories to Focus On

### High Priority Review
- [ ] Third-party dependency CVEs
- [ ] Custom code security patterns
- [ ] Configuration vulnerabilities
- [ ] Authentication/authorization issues

### Medium Priority Review  
- [ ] Logging security (sensitive data exposure)
- [ ] Input validation patterns
- [ ] Cryptographic usage
- [ ] Network communication security

### Low Priority Review
- [ ] Debug configurations in release builds
- [ ] Test code security patterns
- [ ] Development tool configurations

## Final Validation
- [ ] Security scan shows <100 findings after filtering
- [ ] All legitimate findings have mitigation plans
- [ ] Team trained on new suppression rules
- [ ] Documentation updated
