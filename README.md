# Bucika GSR - Standalone TopInfrared Version

## Overview

This is a standalone version of TopInfrared specifically designed for the bucika_gsr project. It combines thermal infrared imaging capabilities with Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) monitoring for multi-modal physiological analysis.

## Key Features

### Hardware Support
- **TC001 Device Only**: Simplified device support focusing only on TC001 thermal imaging
- **Shimmer GSR Sensors**: Integrated support for Shimmer wearable GSR sensors via ShimmerAndroidAPI
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Wireless connection to Shimmer devices

### Software Features
- **English Only Interface**: Simplified language support for English only
- **Real-time GSR Monitoring**: 128 Hz sampling rate for high-precision GSR data collection
- **Thermal IR Integration**: Combined thermal imaging with physiological monitoring
- **Multi-modal Data Sync**: Synchronized collection of thermal and GSR data

### Excluded Components
- House module (removed)
- Edit3D module (removed)
- Multi-language support (English only)
- Multi-device support (TC001 only)
